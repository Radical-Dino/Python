# Python

I used Python 2 and 3 to make some games.

# About the Projects

## Grassland OOP:

It uses object-oriented programming to create a game.

The game is about you surviving in a grassland.

Every single "day", there is a random chance of rain, drought or thunderstorm.

You have to eat the animals and drink water to stay alive.

## Hangman:

I coded this game with Python 2.

The game uses functions, if-else statements and inputs from the user.

You have to guess letters of a word to complete it.

The word is selected from a random selection of words from a list.

## Mega Adventure 1:

This game uses inputs from the user and a lot of if-else statements.

This game is like a story. You game asks you to make a desicion and you make it.

And depending on what answer you give, the game goes in another direction.

There are many endngs to the story and this game-story is part 1 of the entire thing.
